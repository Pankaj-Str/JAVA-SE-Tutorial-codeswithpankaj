// 4. Comparison Operators / Relational Operators:
//    - Equal to (==): Checks if two operands are equal.
//    - Not equal to (!=): Checks if two operands are not equal.
//    - Greater than (>), 
//    - Less than (<), 
//    - Greater than or equal to (>=), 
//    - Less than or equal to (<=) : Perform comparison between operands.
